# Computing in Context 



> Myth does not deny things, on the contrary, its function is to talk about them; simply, it purifies them, it makes them innocent, it gives them a natural and eternal justification, it gives them a clarity which is not that of an explanation but that of a statement of fact. If I state the fact of French imperiality without explaining it, I am very near to finding that it is natural and goes
> without saying: I am reassured. In passing from history to nature, myth acts economically: it abolishes the complexity of human acts, it gives them the simplicity of essences, it does away with all dialectics, with any going back beyond what is immediately visible, it organizes a world which is without contradictions because it is without depth, a world wide open and wallowing in the evident, it establishes a blissful clarity: things appear to mean something by themselves.

We live in a world where we have more data, computational power, and access to digital connectivity than ever before. But how do we make sense of the promise inherent in this reality while also coming to terms with the challenges that it presents? This class is designed to provide a starting point for answering this question by providing an introduction to the social, historical, and critical context of computing, with special attention paid to what viewpoints built into technology and which groups are marginalized in computing. 

In this class, we will use Roland Barthes' concept of myths as self-contained signifying systems as a lens for interrogating the messages embedded within the tech sector and the tools it produces. Each week we will examine a different myth embedded in some aspect of computational society. By pulling  from diverse fields (critical race theory, science and technology studies (STS), critical disability studies, feminist theory, African studies, and postcolonial studies, anthropology, art, and computing), we will aim to enrich our understanding of the tools and platforms that affect us every day, as well as challenge our own understandings of which ideas count as myths or theories. Over the course of the seven weeks, we will attempt to answer the following questions: 

- How do we historically and critically situate the technologies that we have come to take for granted? 
- Who counts as "we" when we speak about technologies with global reaches and infrastructures? 
- Why is it so complicated to speak about "ethics" within computing? 
- How do we create active responses that interrogate and hint at the potential for different futures? 
- As technologists, how do we determine what framework to use for considering the things that we create?

This class is experimental in nature but will be structured like a graduate seminar, with students required to complete a high number of readings and to participate in class discussions. Students will have the opportunity to respond to prompts in homework assignments in text-based, programmatic, and physical ways. At the conclusion of the internship, students will distill the learnings and findings of the semester into some form (for example: a series of articles, workshops, or materials that can be made available to the broader ITP/IMA community; an art piece; a website; an Adjacent issue). 

## Goals 

In this class, students will:

- Consider technology from a sociotechnical and politcal gaze. This entails understanding what technology offers, does, and situating it within its context, history, and variable perspectives
- Investigate different types of and fields for creative response, creation, and exploration, situated within but not limited to, the arts. 
- Create works that engage with and further conversation about emerging technology. 

## Expectations and Requirements

- Class attendance and punctuality
- Participation during class discussions and presentations
- Weekly readings + Final Projects

This class is an inclusive and harassment-free space for everyone, with no tolerations of discrimination based on gender, race, sexual orientation, religion, disability, or appearance. 

## Evaluation

Final evaluation will be based on the completion of all assignments, blogposts, class participation, quality of work, and attendance. 

This class is experimental in nature. Students should be open to changes and invested in improving the class. For the final projects, I am more interested in what you choose to do than in what you can do. We will elaborate on these distinctions in class.
